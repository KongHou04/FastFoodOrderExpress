## Data Folder

The `Data` folder contains SQL files related to the data in the database. These files include scripts for creating, updating, and managing the data within the project's database.

### Usage for Testing

In addition to containing SQL files for the main database, the `Data` folder can also be used to store scripts for testing purposes. This includes creating sample datasets or temporary data structures to test the features and performance of the application.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Create Database**: Use the scripts in the `Data` folder to create and set up the initial database.
2. **Update Database**: When there are changes to the structure or data, use the corresponding scripts to update the database.
3. **Testing**: Use the scripts in the `Data` folder to create sample data for testing the application.

## Note

- Ensure to back up the data before making any changes.
- Carefully review the scripts before running them to avoid potential errors.
